# HANG MAN #
This program is an hang man game.

Graphic interface is not provided, run it in the terminal.

It takes a wordlist from a txt file, it chooses a random word from there and prompt the user to enter a letter.

If the letter is correct, it writes the letter into the corresponding character, if not, it draws the body of the hang man.

If the word is guessed, the player win the game.

When the hang man is drawn entirely, the player lose the game.

### Things to be improved
- unable the player to put into an already guessed letter
- avoid the use of numbers or special characters
